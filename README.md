# Codes Explained

### Enemy AI Targeting

The enemy AI's program attacks the an object that has been tagged "Player", The melee knight has a box collider if the player collides with the melee knight's box collider then the player will take damage. Meanwhile the ranged knight will check whether the player is close enough or not, then it will decide to shoot or not, if the player is too far from the given range then it will go closer to the player, once the ranged knight is close enough then it will stop moving and shoot.
